<section>This exercise is about making lists
<p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>When you make a list, do it in this order:
<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not a ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
        <ul>
            <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>

    <p>Here's a couple of ways you can express yourself</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</li>
    <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
</ul>

You did it! You should be proud of yourself
